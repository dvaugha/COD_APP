HOW TO SAVE THE GOLF APP TO YOUR PHONE

This app works best when saved to your home screen! It will look and feel like a native app.

=== FOR IPHONE (iOS) ===
1. Open the link in the **Safari** browser. (Crucial: Chrome/Firefox on iOS won't work for this).
2. Tap the **Share Icon** at the bottom of the screen (it looks like a square with an arrow pointing up).
3. Scroll down the menu and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4. You can name it "COD Golf" or keep the default.
5. Tap **"Add"** in the top right corner.
6. The app icon will appear on your home screen!

=== FOR ANDROID ===
1. Open the link in the **Chrome** browser.
2. Tap the **Menu Icon** (three dots) in the top right corner.
3. Select **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install App"** from the list.
4. Follow the prompt and tap **"Add"** or **"Install"**.
5. The app icon will appear on your home screen!
